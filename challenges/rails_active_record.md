## RAILS: ActiveRecord Challenge

* Create a migration for storing survey results submitted on `home/form`.  It needs five fields (matching the HTML form fields), plus an `id` field.

* Whenever the form is submitted, create a new record in the database.

* Change the "Thank You" view to show information out of the database rather than out of params.

* Reflect (in your README): This migration was probably pretty dissatisfying to create.  How would you change your migration to make the survey more flexible in the future?
