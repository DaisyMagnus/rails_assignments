## RAILS: Session Challenge

* Use the session to prevent any user from submitting the form more than once (even if he/she uses the back button).  Do not add a users table or require people to log in.

* Reflect: Now that you've put a restriction in place, how can the user get past it?

* Reflect: Why is it bad to just validate the uniqueness of the name field?
