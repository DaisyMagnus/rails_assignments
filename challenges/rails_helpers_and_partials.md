## RAILS: Helpers and Partials

* Your form currently has four mostly-repeated sections, once for each question you can answer with a checkbox.  Extract this duplicated code into a partial and call the partial four times.

* Reflect (in your README): When are partials better to use than helpers?  When is the opposite true?
