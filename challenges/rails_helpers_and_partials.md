## RAILS: Helpers and Partials

* Your form currently has four mostly-repeated lines to show the checkboxes.  The thank-you page also has four mostly-repeated lines to display the results.  DRY out this duplication.

* Reflect (in your README): When are partials better to use than helpers?  When is the opposite true?
