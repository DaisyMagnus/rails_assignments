# Legacy Associations and Validations

## Description

Take an existing legacy codebase with no associations or validations and add them.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Become more comfortable working with code which you did not write
* Become more comfortable adding functionality to an existing codebase
* Understand how two developers can work on the same codebase
* Be able to branch your code
* Be able to handle merge conflicts
* Be able to write associations
* Be able to write validations
* Be able to add tests to verify associations and validations

## Deliverables

* **A GitHub organization.**  Your team should create a new organization in GitHub for this assignment.
* **A pull request to this repository.**  Fork this repository to your organization, do the work, then create a pull request.
* **A modified README.**
* **A modified test suite.**

Use the homework submission form on the course website to state when you are done.

## Normal Mode

Your assignment is to take the existing code in this folder and add associations and validations to it.  You will be working with a partner, but you will be branching your code, splitting the tasks amongst the two of you, and working on them separately.  Once you have finished your separate tasks, then you will merge your branches together and deal with any merge conflicts that arise.

If you would like, you can merge your branches more than once.

The tasks will be divided as follows.

Person A:


Person B:



## Hard Mode

Now that you're in the database, there's a whole series of additional things that you can test.  Add ten database-specific tests to your test suite.
