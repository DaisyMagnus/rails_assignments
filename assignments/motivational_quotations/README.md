### Deliverables

* **A Repository.** Fork this Github repository.  Commit often, not just at the end.
* **Your First Rails App!**

### Requirements

From the user's point of view:

* The user should be able to go to the root URL of the application and be asked for their current mood.  The mood should be selected from a dropdown with a pre-defined set of moods (determined by you).
* The user should be able to submit their mood via an HTML form, and he/she will then be presented with a motivational quotation.
* An image related to the quotation should be shown on the quotation page as well.
* The user should be able to link from the list page back to the mood selection page to request another quotation

In terms of code:

* The application should have two views, one controller, and one model.
* The model should be called `Quotation`, and it should be respond to a method that returns the text of the quotation and also to a method that returns a URL of the related image.

## Normal Mode

'Nuff said.  Meet all of the requirements given above.

## Hard Mode

Rather than showing a quotation and and image separately, display an image with text overlaid by integrating with the memegenerator.net API.  Documentation is linked below.
