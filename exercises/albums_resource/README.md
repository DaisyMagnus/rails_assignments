# Albums Resource

## Description

Create a Rails app with one database table and standard CRUD actions.

## Instructions

You (once again) want to keep track of all the albums you own.  This time, we'll keep it simple and not bother associating the albums with artists or keeping track of quantities in stock.  You want to know the following about each of the albums you own:

* Title
* Artist Name
* Year Released
* Length (in minutes)

This time, you're building a Rails app around this data table which will allow you to manage your list of albums via HTML pages and forms.  Your Rails app should allow you to do the following:

* See all albums
* Make a new album
* See an existing album
* Edit an existing album
* Delete an existing album

I know: it's a lot.  Get as far as you can. You are not expected to finish.
