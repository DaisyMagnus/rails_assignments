# 12 Days of Christmas

## Description

Create a program to print out the lyrics to "The 12 Days of Christmas."

## Instructions

You sing for a 1780s cover band, but sadly, you always forget the lyrics to "The 12 Days of Christmas".  Given your love for the 1780s, you decide that you need software to solve this problem.

Write a program to print out the lyrics to "The 12 Days of Christmas."  It should include at least two methods:

* `verse(number)` - If this method is passed a 2, it will `puts` a line about turtle doves AND a line about partridge in a pear tree.
* `entire_song()` - When this method is called, the output will include all 12 verses.  This means that the user will see the line about the pear tree 12 total times.

As always, you have [the Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Twelve_Days_of_Christmas_%28song%29) to help you (as the developer) with the lyrics.
