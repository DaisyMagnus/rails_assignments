# Menu Authentication

## Description

Modify your menu application so that people can log in, and only allow those who have logged in to edit the items.

## Instructions

Sadly, even though your client loved your menu app, your arch-nemesis (Captain Haxorz) has stumbled upon it.  Given that Haxorz has no scruples, the menu items have been gradually changing from things like "Chocolate Cake" to... well... it's not polite to say these things out loud.

Add authentication so visitors to your site have to log in before they can see or do anything.
