# Shirt Class

## Description

Fix an error, simplify the code, and add defaults to an existing Shirt class.

## Instructions

Examine `shirt.rb`.  Feel free to save it on your computer or paste it into `irb`.  

Answer the following questions:

* Which method is a class method?
* Where is the bug in one of the instance methods?
* Which method is a "getter" method, and which method is a "setter" method?
* What one line of code could you write to get rid of both the getter and the setter at the same time?
* What two lines of code could you write (after this class definition) to create a new shirt object with a color of "Blue", then change its color to "Red"?
* How can you change line 2 (and JUST line 2) so that you don't have to give a color when creating a new shirt?
