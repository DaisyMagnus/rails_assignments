# My First Git Repo

## Description

Create a few files and go through the basic git workflow.

## Instructions

Your boss has asked you to keep track of employees (with their names and salaries), departments (with their names), and which employees are in which department.  You should be able to:

* Get an employee's name.
* Give raises to an individual.
* Give raises to a department.

Run `git init` in a new folder.  Create an Employee class (store it in `employee.rb`) and a Department class (store it in `department.rb`).  Make sure that you've committed all of your work.
