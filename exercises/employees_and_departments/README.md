# Employees and Departments

## Description

Create two classes to store, change, and communicate information about employees.

## Instructions

You are an employer who has just recently hired a bunch of people.  Unfortunately, you can no longer keep all of their names straight, and you've got no hope of remembering which department they work with.

You want to keep track of employees (with their names and salaries), departments (with their names), and which employees are in which department.  You should be able to:

* Create a new department.
* Create a new employee.
* Add an employee to a department.
* Get an employee's name.
* Give raises to an individual.
* Give raises to a department.
