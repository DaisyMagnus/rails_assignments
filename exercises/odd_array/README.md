# Employees and Departments

## Description

Create two classes and place behavior on the appropriate classes.

## Instructions

Your boss has asked you to keep track of employees (with their names and salaries), departments (with their names), and which employees are in which department.  You should be able to:

* Get an employee's name.
* Give raises to an individual.
* Give raises to a department.

Create an Employee class and a Department class in a single Ruby file.  Use your best judgement to place methods on these classes to accomplish the above goals.  Give those methods good names.  Don't forget initializers!
