# My First Website

## Description

Create a website on Codepen to describe your team.

## Instructions

Assume that your team is going to start a company together, and that company is going to make it BIG.  Use Codepen to write an "About Us" page which describes your team.  Be as irreverent as you would like.

Your page must include at least one of each of the following:

* A paragraph
* A `div`
* A `span`
* An image
* An unordered list
* A header
* An embedded video
