# Assorted JSON

## Description

Take your existing voting_api app and add two actions to the candidates controller which are very similar to index.

## Instructions

You have a handy app for entering and viewing votes.  Congrats!  However, user requirements have grown, and you need your API to do more now.

You have a candidates `index` action which shows name, party, etc for all candidates.  You now need to make a candidates `counts` action which is similar, but which also shows the total number of votes received.  You also need to make a `list` action which only shows names.

Write code to generate all three of these (frustratingly similar) API endpoints.
