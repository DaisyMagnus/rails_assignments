# Folder Structure

## Description

Now that you've dealt with multiple types of code, invent a standard folder structure to keep all your code straight.

## Instructions

Since week one, you've built code which spans multiple files.  However, at this point you've been dealing with code (and other files) of many different types.  Here is a list:

* Ruby classes
* Executable Ruby code
* Gemfiles
* Tests
* Migrations
* Shared header code (e.g. `establish_connection`)
* Database files (ending in .sqlite3)
* ... any others?

It's getting sort of crazy, isn't it?

Since we have a strong desire for order, let's develop a standard.  Assume that each project you're working on will be in its own folder.  Within the scope of one project, specify which subfolders should exist and indicate which types of files should go where.
