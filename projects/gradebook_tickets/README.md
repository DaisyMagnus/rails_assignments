# Gradebook Tickets

## Description

Given an existing version of the Gradebook application, students will form groups and work on tickets to improve the project, then progressively merge changes together.

## Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should...

* Understand some complications of developing in large groups
* Understand some complications of developing on legacy code
* Be able to claim GitHub issues and work on them
* Be able to work in all areas of a Rails application

## Deliverables

* **A workflow diagram.**  Any format is fine, including paper.
* **An estimate.**  After you read through this assignment (but before you start coding), write down a number of hours that you expect each part to take (1-3).  Record your hours as you go.
* **A Repository.** Create a new repository your own github organization's account.
* **A README.**
* **A test suite.** Build your application using TDD.  Your test suite must include unit tests, controller tests, and at least two integration tests.
* **A reflection on your estimate.**

## Normal Mode

For this weekend project, you will be claiming a GitHub issue which exists on this project.  The issue description contains the details you need to get started.

You will work in pairs to complete your GitHub issue and create a pull request.  You will then work with the group which finishes closest in time to you to merge your changes together.  Then your group of four will work with another group of four to merge four issues together.  Then the entire class will work to merge everything into one app.

You should deploy to Heroku as a pair, then as a group of four, then as a group of eight.
